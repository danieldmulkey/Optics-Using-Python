## Installation
Clone the repository with GitHub Desktop or download the zip file.

The recommended Python environment is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), 
so as to remove the necessity of installing NumPy, SciPy, and other libraries manually.
## Usage
On a fresh Anaconda installation, you should be able open the folder in VS code or 
another editor and run `pytest` from the root directory with passing results.

To follow along with the book, open the code folder corresponding to the book chapter. 
The majority of the examples in the text of the book come from the Python files named 
after the chapter (e.g. `ch1.py` for chapter 1).

It is recommeneded to open the entire folder `Optics-Using-Python` in your preferred editor 
and to run the relevant chapter files manually. When imports are introduced, this ensures 
everything plays nicely.
## Contributing
If you find bugs, please file an issue! I am eager to ensure the codebase stays healthy and useful to many.
